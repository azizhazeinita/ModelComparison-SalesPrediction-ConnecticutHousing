# Housing Sales Prediction of Connecticut Single Family House

***A personal project by Azizha Zeinita***

**Project Goal:**

This project aims to **predict the number of sales of Connecticut housing** using **different kind of supervised models**, which includes some kind of housing categories. The initial features including the **time of sales, monthly number of sales, residential/housing category, and location county**. The **drawback of this dataset** is only providing number of sales without giving the number of unit available of each building, so we can't know how good the sales percentage is to measure the sales success. It's different if we use price as the targeted variable.
